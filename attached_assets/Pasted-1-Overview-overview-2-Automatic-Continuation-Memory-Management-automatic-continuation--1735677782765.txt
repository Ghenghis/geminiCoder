## 1. Overview
Building on top of the **existing GeminiCoder features** (AI code generation, modern Next.js structure, integrated UI components, and a Prisma-backed database), this set of **advanced capabilities** focuses on **large project support**. The primary goals are:

- **Seamless continuation** of generated code when token limits are reached  
- **Robust error handling** and code validation during generation  
- **Improved scalability** for enterprise teams working on complex applications  
- **Enhanced productivity** through automatic merging, refactoring, and version management

## 2. Automatic Continuation & Memory Management
**Key Benefit**: Prevent losing context mid-generation, ensuring large files or multiple files are fully generated without user intervention.

- **Continuous Code Stream**:  
  When the LLM (Large Language Model) hits a token limit, the system automatically **requests continuation** using stored context. No manual prompts are needed from the user to keep generating.  
- **Memory Buffering**:  
  Utilize an **intelligent memory buffer** that stores conversation and code states. If the model runs out of tokens, it references the buffer to **pick up exactly where it left off**.  
- **Context Pruning**:  
  Automatically remove or condense irrelevant parts of the conversation history to preserve crucial context while staying within token limits.

## 3. Chunked Code Generation & Large File Handling
**Key Benefit**: Generate and assemble **massive codebases** in a well-structured manner, preventing out-of-memory errors or incomplete outputs.

- **Chunk-Based Strategy**:  
  Split large files into **manageable chunks** and generate code piece by piece. All chunks are then **stiched together** into a single file with the correct order and indentation.  
- **Automatic Indentation & Formatting**:  
  After each chunk is generated, apply a unified **Prettier/ESLint** run to ensure consistent style and indentation across all chunks.  
- **Parallel Processing**:  
  When generating multiple files, run chunk creation in **parallel** for improved efficiency, then merge results into a cohesive project structure.

## 4. Real-Time Error Detection & Self-Correction
**Key Benefit**: Save development time by catching errors and ensuring the generated code is production-ready.

- **Syntax Validation**:  
  Immediately validate each chunk of generated code for **syntax errors**. If an error is detected, the system automatically requests corrections from the LLM.  
- **Contextual Error Feedback**:  
  The LLM receives **feedback** on exactly where the error occurred and what type it is (syntax, type, etc.) for precise troubleshooting.  
- **Linting & Code Smell Detection**:  
  Integrate advanced ESLint rules to detect code smells and propose **refactoring** suggestions on the fly.

---

## 5. Context-Aware Refactoring & Merging
**Key Benefit**: Enhance code quality and maintainability without manual intervention.

- **Smart Refactoring**:  
  The LLM identifies repetitive patterns or inefficient logic across multiple files or code chunks, and **automatically refactors**.  
- **Multi-File Merge**:  
  When dealing with different modules requiring the same function or snippet, the system **merges** them into a shared utility or library.  
- **Conflict Resolution**:  
  Integrate with version control systems (e.g., Git) to **auto-resolve minor merge conflicts**, prompting the user only when manual input is necessary.
